# Korea University Computer System and Design class assignments and project
### Examples with ARM assembly and C code using Zynq-7000 in Zed board

## Hardware
Zedboard (http://www.zedboard.org/)

## Language
ARM assembly & C code

## Environment
- Xilinx Vivado and SDK tools (v21.1) (www.xilinx.com)
- Tera Term (For UART communication)

## Description
`Mini-Project`
- Mini-OS(Operating System) with round-robin scheduler
for three applications

`Assignment#1`
- Program that sorts data in ascending order from the smallest to the largest

`Assignment#2`
- Program that turns on one LED at a time, starting from LED0 to LED7 and wrapping around with switches that determine duration

`Assignment#3`
- Debugging macro in ARM assembly which prints out all the registers (R0~R15) and CPSR of the current mode to the UART terminal (Tera Term)

`Assignment#4`
- Compare code density between ARM instructions and Thumb2 instructions

`Assignment#5`
- Digital watch using interrupt from the private timer

`Assignment#6`
- Checking cache's impact on performance with LED blinking interval

`Assignment#7`
- Checking the effect of virtual memory by writing a simple program with page tables
